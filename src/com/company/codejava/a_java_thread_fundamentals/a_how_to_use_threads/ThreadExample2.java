         * sometimes the thread main runs first.
         * This can be recognized by the order of thread names in the output changes randomly.
         * That means thereâ€™s no guarantee of which thread runs first as they are both started concurrently.
         * You should bear in mind this behavior with regard to multi-threading context.
